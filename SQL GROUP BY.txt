# aggregate functions:
AVG() # Returns a float value. use ROUND(AVG(),2) to return 2 decimal places
SUM()
COUNT()
MAX()
MIN()

# examples
SELECT MAX(price), MIN(price) FROM Goods;

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Goods;

SELECT ROUND(AVG(price),2) FROM Goods;

# using GROUP BY to aggregate columns per specified category (must appear after FORM or WHERE statement):
# in the SELECT statement, columns referenced must be in the GROUP BY call or have an aggregate function
# WHERE statements should not affect results from aggregate function
SELECT brand, color, SUM(price) 
FROM gpu
WHERE brand IN ('EVGA', 'ASUS')
GROUP BY brand, color

# to sort results based off aggregate, reference the entire function
SELECT brand, SUM(price)
FROM gpu
GROUP BY SUM(price)

# using HAVING clause to filter after an aggregate function has taken place
# used since WHERE filters before aggregate function takes place
SELECT brand, SUM(price)
FROM gpu
WHERE brand != 'EVGA'
GROUP BY brand
HAVING SUM(price) > 1000
