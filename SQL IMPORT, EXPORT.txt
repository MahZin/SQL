# importing data from a .csv file to an already existing table

# *Note: the file path to your outside file must be 100% correct

# working through with an example:
# 1. Create an excel sheet with columns: A, B, C and row values: 1-9 vertically placed top-bot
# 2. Download the sheet as a .csv file
# 3. Open properties and copy file path
# 4. Create a table in SQL:
CREATE TABLE simple(
 a INTEGER,
 b INTEGER,
 c INTEGER
) 

SELECT * FROM simple
# above code will create a table called simple in SQL with 3 rows: a,b,c with all datatype as INTEGER
# 5. Right-click the table under Tables tab and click Import/Export
# 6. Click to change switch to Import. Under Filename locate the created excel table
# *Note: Under Columns tab we can check and uncheck columns we want to import
# *Note: Under Miscellaeneous we can switch Header to Yes, for the first row A, B, C so we don't duplicate information i.e. PostGreSQL will ignore first row
# # 7. Choose Delimiter. We choose , (comma) since it's a comma separated value table then click OK

SELECT * FROM simple

# to export:
# 1. Right-click Import/Export
# 2. Decide what columns you want to export
# 3. Choose where you want to save the file. Rename if needed, choose Delimiter etc. then press OK
